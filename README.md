## Pokedex
This project is a simple pokedex to show pokemons games and cities. You can check it [here](https://alanneves.github.io/pokedex/)

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Vue 2
* Vuex
* Vue Router
* Bootstrap Vue
* Axios
* FontAwesome

## Challenges
The main challenge for me was building the interface without a prototype. I decided to use bootstrap to make it easier.

## What i would like to do
I would like to do unit tests. Also, I would like to use Storybook to document the components. But time was running out.
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alanneves/pokedex.git
$ cd pokedex
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
